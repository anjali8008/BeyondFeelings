               <strong>HI !</strong><br>
                Isn't this how our conversation started when I texted you the first day. Yes, I know<br>
                you might find it funny reading this message/letter. Hasna math bass nhi toh maarungi ! I know I'm not much expressive<br>
                or talkative, aur kabhi kabhi mujhe bhi khud par gussa aata hai iss baat ko lekar but, iska matlab ye nhi ki I don't care about you<br>
                or I don't love you. I do ! So, isiliye I wanted to do something special and this is it.<br>
                Shuru karti hu puri kahani toh tumhare baare mein he hai waise bhi.<br>
                So at first when I approached you mujhe lagtha tha ki iss bande mein kuch zyaada he attitude
                hai. Q ki normal handsome bande khadoos dikhte hai woh alag baat hai samjho. So, mujhe bhi utna
                interest nahi tha isiliye I didn't take any kind of step. But, later jo bhi baat hota tha thoda bohot dheere dheere
                achaa lagne laga that you're very calm, kind and soft-spoken. But, then I thought that this story
                might stop here itself. Lekin nahi abhi toh bohot kuch baaki hai. I liked you and at that moment
                jab hum uss samay baat karte the aur mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai 'OCT 17' tumne bohot dino baad message
                kiya tha.<br> Are maine exams hai kya bol diya tumne toh mahino bhar message he nahi kiya. Chalo thik hai woh choro.
                Lekin asli khushi mujhe tab hui when we met for the first time 'JAN 7th' - tumhe yaad nhi hai pata hai mujhe bhulakkad.
                Mujhe waise laga nhi tha ki is janam mein mera koi boyfriend hoga aur jo itni dur aayega mujhse milne and still it happened.
                God's plan I guess. Uss din ke baad bhi mujhe kuch bhi bade expectations nahi the but, pata hai na jo sochte hai woh nhi hota.
                So, again I started feeling like I'm on a cloud nine and I still do. Who knew my feelings would grow to such
                an extent that I'd fall in love with you. Pata hai thodi cringe aur cheesy lag rahi hai ye lines
                But, these are just what I genuinely feel for you. <br>And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way.I know we have distance 
                between us, but that doesn't scare me. It makes me appreciate every moment and whichever memory we share
                together. Moreover, even though we're far apart, I don't feel the distance as much as I thought I would. You're always 
                in my thoughts and in my heart.  We have ways of staying connected video calls, messages, phone calls. 
                It's not the same as being together, but it's enough for now. It's enough because it's you. <br>Just thinking
                about you makes me the happiest person alive. Aur haan kehte hai na 'There comes a person once in a lifetime
                whom we can never unlove' and finally abhi pata chal raha hai ki iska matlab kya hai. So, for me that person
                would be you. Aur haan har roz miss karti hun yaar tumhe bhale he express nahi kati mein utna. But, I MISS YOU always.
                and lastly, <br>
                I love you more than words can say, and I miss you more than words can express. But, still it's the only way so,<br>
               <strong>I LOVE YOU > > > ❤️</strong>
